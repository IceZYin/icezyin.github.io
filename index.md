## About

I am a third-year PhD candidate in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I studies about ice sheet-climate interactions, particularly the surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and am interested in improving ice sheet modeling and our understanding about ice sheet processes.
